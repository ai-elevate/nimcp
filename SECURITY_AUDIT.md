- [ ] Add regression tests for found bugs
- [ ] Build corpus for future fuzzing campaigns

#### Error Injection
- [ ] Run error injection tests: `nimcp_tests --gtest_filter="ErrorInjection*"`
- [ ] Verify graceful handling of:
  - [ ] Memory allocation failures
  - [ ] NULL pointer inputs
  - [ ] Invalid parameter values

  - [ ] Rapid creation/destruction cycles
- [ ] Monitor for memory leaks during stress tests
- [ ] Check for performance degradation

### 3. Build Security

#### Compiler Hardening

- [ ] Verify RELRO enabled: `readelf -d build/lib/libnimcp_core.so | grep RELRO`
- [ ] Verify NX enabled: `readelf -l build/lib/libnimcp_core.so | grep GNU_STACK`
- [ ] Check for position-independent code: `readelf -h build/lib/libnimcp_core.so | grep Type`

#### Dependencies
- [ ] Run dependency scan: `./scripts/dependency-scan.sh --report --strict`
- [ ] Update all outdated dependencies
- [ ] Review security advisories for all dependencies

- [ ] Check license compliance

### 4. API Security

#### Public API Review
- [ ] Review all public APIs for:
  - [ ] Parameter validation
  - [ ] Return value checking
  - [ ] Thread safety
