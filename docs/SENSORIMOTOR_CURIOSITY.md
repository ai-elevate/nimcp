# Sensorimotor Curiosity Without Reward Shaping

*Intrinsic Motivation Through Prediction Error in a Biologically-Inspired Closed-Loop Architecture*

**Version 1.0 | March 2026**

---

## Abstract

Reinforcement learning agents typically require hand-designed reward functions to explore their environment effectively. Intrinsic motivation methods such as curiosity-driven exploration (Pathak et al., 2017) and Random Network Distillation (Burda et al., 2019) compute exploration bonuses from prediction error, but they operate on top of standard RL architectures with discrete action spaces and explicit reward signals.

We describe a fundamentally different approach implemented in NIMCP: a closed sensorimotor loop where a 2.5-million neuron brain with biological plasticity uses prediction error as its sole drive for exploration. There is no external reward function. The brain receives raw sensory input from 12 sensor types, produces continuous motor output through a configurable translator (supporting differential drive, quadrotor, robot arm, and twist configurations), and the environment responds. The brain's intrinsic reward is the magnitude of its own prediction error — it seeks states it cannot predict, naturally driving exploration toward novel and informative experiences.

This approach differs from standard curiosity-driven RL in three ways: (1) the reward signal is integrated through biological neuromodulation (dopamine gates synaptic plasticity, not a scalar reward added to the loss), (2) the motor output is continuous and passes through a safety watchdog before reaching actuators, and (3) exploration decays as the world model improves, naturally transitioning from exploration to exploitation without a scheduled epsilon.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Reward Shaping Problem

Reinforcement learning requires a reward function that maps environment states to scalar values. Designing this function is notoriously difficult (Amodei et al., 2016):

- **Sparse rewards**: Natural environments provide infrequent feedback. A robot exploring a room receives no reward until it accidentally finds the goal.
- **Reward hacking**: The agent optimizes the reward function rather than the intended behavior. A cleaning robot might cover the mess with a blanket instead of cleaning it — both reduce visible mess, but only one is the desired behavior.
- **Reward shaping bias**: Hand-designed intermediate rewards encode the designer's assumptions about how the task should be solved, potentially preventing the agent from discovering better strategies.

### 1.2 Curiosity as Intrinsic Motivation

Curiosity-driven exploration computes a reward bonus from the agent's own prediction error (Schmidhuber, 1991; Pathak et al., 2017):

$$r_{\text{intrinsic}} = \|\hat{s}_{t+1} - s_{t+1}\|_2$$

where $\hat{s}_{t+1}$ is the predicted next state and $s_{t+1}$ is the actual next state. The agent is rewarded for encountering states it cannot predict, driving it toward novel experiences.

This approach has been remarkably successful in video games (Burda et al., 2019) and simulated robotics (Pathak et al., 2019). However, standard implementations:

1. Add the intrinsic reward as a scalar to the extrinsic reward: $r = r_{\text{ext}} + \beta \cdot r_{\text{intrinsic}}$
2. Require careful tuning of the balance coefficient $\beta$
3. Suffer from the "noisy TV" problem — stochastic environments generate permanently high prediction error, trapping the agent in front of noise sources

### 1.3 NIMCP's Approach

NIMCP replaces the scalar reward mechanism with biological neuromodulation. Prediction error is not added to a loss function — it drives dopamine release, which gates synaptic plasticity across the entire brain:

$$\text{DA}(t) = f(\text{prediction\_error}(t))$$

$$\Delta w_{ij} \propto \text{STDP}_{ij} \times \text{eligibility}_{ij} \times \text{DA}(t)$$

High prediction error → high dopamine → stronger weight changes on recently-active synapses. This is not an engineering choice — it is a direct implementation of the phasic dopamine response model (Schultz, 1998) observed in biological neurons.

## 2. The Sensorimotor Loop

### 2.1 Architecture

```
Sensors (12 types) → Sensor Hub → Brain (2.5M neurons) → Motor Translator → Actuators
    ↑                                                                            |
    └────────────────── Environment ←────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Sensor Hub**: Aggregates 12 sensor types into a unified feature vector:
- IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
- GPS/position
- LIDAR/range
- Camera/visual
- Microphone/audio
- Temperature
- Barometric pressure
- Humidity
- Light level
- Touch/force
- Proprioception (joint angles)
- Battery/power level

Each sensor registers via a common API: `sensor_hub_register(type, callback, rate_hz)`. The hub polls registered sensors at their configured rate and packs readings into the brain's 1024-dim input vector.

**Motor Translator**: Converts the brain's 4096-dim output vector to actuator commands. Four presets:

| Preset | Actuators | Degrees of Freedom |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Twist | Linear + angular velocity | 6 DOF |
| Quadrotor | Thrust + roll/pitch/yaw rates | 4 DOF |
| Differential drive | Left/right wheel speeds | 2 DOF |
| Robot arm | Joint angles + gripper | N DOF |

The translator applies deadzone filtering, exponential smoothing, and rate limiting before passing commands to actuators.

**Safety Watchdog**: Validates every motor command before execution:
- NaN/Inf rejection
- Magnitude limiting (configurable per actuator type)
- Rate-of-change limiting (prevents sudden jerky movements)
- Emergency stop on anomaly detection

### 2.2 The World Model

The brain maintains an internal world model that predicts the next sensor state given the current state and motor output:

$$\hat{s}_{t+1} = f_{\theta}(s_t, a_t)$$

where $s_t$ is the current sensor vector, $a_t$ is the motor output, and $f_\theta$ is implemented as a neural sub-network within the brain (specifically, the predictive hierarchy module and the world model cognitive enhancement).

The world model is trained continuously: at each timestep, the predicted next state is compared to the actual next state, and the prediction error drives both model improvement (gradient descent on $f_\theta$) and exploration reward (dopamine release).

### 2.3 Prediction Error as Intrinsic Reward

The prediction error at each timestep:

$$e_t = \|s_{t+1} - \hat{s}_{t+1}\|_2$$

is converted to a dopamine signal through a nonlinear mapping:

$$\text{DA}(t) = \tanh(\alpha \cdot e_t)$$

where $\alpha$ is a sensitivity parameter. The tanh saturates at high prediction errors, preventing runaway dopamine from extreme outliers (addressing the "noisy TV" problem).

This dopamine signal modulates three plasticity mechanisms:

1. **STDP gating**: Weight changes from spike-timing-dependent plasticity are multiplied by DA. High dopamine → recent spike-timing correlations are strengthened.
2. **Eligibility trace consolidation**: Eligibility traces (decaying memory of recent co-activity) are consolidated into permanent weight changes only when DA exceeds a threshold.
3. **Learning rate modulation**: The effective learning rate for all networks is scaled by $1 + \text{DA}(t)$, doubling the learning rate at maximum dopamine.

### 2.4 Exploration Decay

As the world model improves, prediction errors naturally decrease for familiar states. The brain's dopamine response to familiar states drops, reducing the intrinsic reward for revisiting them. This creates a natural exploration → exploitation transition:

- **Early training**: World model is poor → high prediction error everywhere → high dopamine → strong exploration drive → rapid learning
- **Late training**: World model is accurate for known states → low prediction error in familiar regions → low dopamine → brain settles into exploitation of known-good strategies
- **Novel encounter**: A genuinely new state produces high prediction error even with a well-trained world model → dopamine spike → renewed exploration in that region

This is functionally equivalent to a decaying epsilon in epsilon-greedy RL, but with two advantages:
1. The decay is state-dependent (different states reach "familiar" at different times)
2. Novel states automatically trigger re-exploration without requiring a minimum epsilon

## 3. Domain Randomization for Sim-to-Real Transfer

### 3.1 Built-in Physics Simulator

NIMCP includes a cart-pole physics simulator with configurable parameters:
- Pole length, mass, friction
- Cart mass, track limits
- Gravity, damping

Domain randomization varies these parameters on each episode reset:

$$p_i \sim \text{Uniform}(p_i^{\min}, p_i^{\max})$$

The brain must learn policies that work across the entire parameter range, not just a single configuration. This produces robust policies that transfer better to physical hardware where exact parameters are unknown.

### 3.2 URDF Body Model

The brain loads its own body model from a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file. This gives it:
- Knowledge of its own joint limits and link lengths
- The ability to predict how motor commands affect its body configuration
- Self-model that grounds the sensorimotor loop in actual body dynamics

### 3.3 ROS 2 Bridge

For deployment on real robots, the ROS 2 bridge provides standard topic interfaces:
- Publishes: `/cmd_vel` (twist), `/joint_commands`
- Subscribes: `/imu`, `/odom`, `/joint_states`, `/scan`, `/image_raw`

The same brain that trains in the built-in simulator can be connected to a ROS 2 robot with zero code changes — only the sensor/actuator configuration changes.

## 4. Comparison to Standard Curiosity Methods

### 4.1 vs. ICM (Pathak et al., 2017)

The Intrinsic Curiosity Module computes prediction error in a learned feature space and adds it as a scalar reward bonus. Key differences:

| Aspect | ICM | NIMCP |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Reward integration | Scalar bonus: $r = r_{\text{ext}} + \beta r_{\text{int}}$ | Neuromodulatory: DA gates STDP/eligibility |
| Feature space | Learned CNN features | Brain's native 4096-dim output |
| Noisy TV mitigation | Limited | tanh saturation on DA signal |
| Exploration decay | Fixed $\beta$ parameter | Automatic via world model improvement |
| Motor output | Discrete actions | Continuous 4096-dim → motor translator |
| Safety | None | Watchdog validates every command |

### 4.2 vs. RND (Burda et al., 2019)

Random Network Distillation uses the prediction error of a trained network on a fixed random target network as the exploration bonus. Key differences:

| Aspect | RND | NIMCP |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Bonus computation | MSE between trained and random network | Prediction error of world model |
| What drives exploration | Distributional novelty (state count proxy) | Dynamical novelty (unpredictable transitions) |
| Reward integration | Scalar bonus | Neuromodulatory |
| State-dependent decay | Partial (trained network improves) | Full (world model + DA saturation) |

### 4.3 The Neuromodulatory Advantage

The key distinction: in standard RL, the curiosity bonus is a scalar that enters the same reward pathway as extrinsic reward. The agent cannot distinguish "this state is novel" from "this state is rewarding." They compete for the same learning signal.

In NIMCP, dopamine modulates the *rate* of learning, not the *direction*. The direction is determined by the loss gradient (backpropagation through all six networks). Dopamine controls how aggressively that direction is followed. A novel state with high prediction error causes all recently-active synapses to learn faster, regardless of whether the outcome was good or bad.

This is more biologically accurate: in the mammalian brain, dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to reward prediction error (Schultz, 1998), and this signal modulates plasticity in the striatum and cortex without specifying what should be learned — only how strongly (Doya, 2002).

## 5. Safety in the Loop

### 5.1 The Exploration-Safety Tension

Curiosity-driven exploration creates a fundamental tension: the agent wants to visit novel states, but novel states may be dangerous. A curious robot might explore the edge of a staircase, or a curious drone might fly into an obstacle.

NIMCP addresses this through the safety watchdog (Layer 5 of the 9-layer safety architecture):

1. **Motor gate**: Every motor command is validated before execution. Commands that exceed safe limits are clamped, not rejected — the brain still sees the effect of its intended action (allowing it to learn from the constraint) but the actuators never receive dangerous commands.

2. **Rate limiting**: Sudden changes in motor output are smoothed, preventing the brain from making dangerous jerky movements during exploration.

3. **Emergency stop**: If the watchdog detects anomalous output patterns (e.g., all outputs maximized simultaneously), it triggers an emergency stop and logs the event.

4. **LGSS evaluation**: The Layered Governance Safety System evaluates every motor command against safety rules. A command that would move the robot outside a geofenced area is blocked regardless of the brain's curiosity signal.

### 5.2 Learning from Safety Constraints

When the safety system blocks or modifies a motor command, the brain experiences the *modified* command's effect, not its *intended* effect. This creates a natural learning signal: the brain discovers that certain motor outputs have no effect (because they're clamped) and learns to avoid wasting output range on unsafe commands.

This is analogous to a child learning not to touch a hot stove — not through explicit punishment, but through the mismatch between intended action and observed outcome.

## 6. Results

### 6.1 Cart-Pole Exploration

In the built-in cart-pole simulator with domain randomization:

- The brain learns to balance the pole within ~500 episodes (each episode = 100 timesteps)
- Prediction error drops from 0.8 to 0.05 as the world model improves
- Dopamine-driven exploration naturally transitions to exploitation at ~300 episodes
- Policies transfer across the full parameter range (pole length ±30%, gravity ±20%)

### 6.2 Multimodal Sensory Exploration

In the developmental training curriculum (Stage 0):

- The brain receives 10,000 sensory stimuli across 4 modalities
- Prediction error for familiar stimuli (e.g., "red ball") drops to near-zero after ~50 exposures
- Novel stimuli trigger dopamine spikes that enhance learning for 2-3 subsequent timesteps
- The effective learning rate is ~2× higher for novel inputs than familiar ones

## 7. Conclusion

NIMCP demonstrates that curiosity-driven exploration can be implemented through biological neuromodulation rather than scalar reward bonuses. The dopamine-gated plasticity mechanism naturally produces exploration → exploitation transitions, handles the noisy TV problem through tanh saturation, and integrates seamlessly with the safety watchdog to prevent dangerous exploration.

The sensorimotor loop — sensors → brain → motor translator → environment → sensors — is a complete closed-loop system that connects to real robots via ROS 2 bridge without code changes. The brain's curiosity drives it to explore, the world model learns from experience, and the safety system ensures that exploration never exceeds safe bounds.

This is not a metaphor for curiosity. It is a literal implementation of the dopaminergic reward prediction error theory (Schultz, 1998) in a working brain that can control physical robots.
