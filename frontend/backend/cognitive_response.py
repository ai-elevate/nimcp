"""Cognitive interpreter — translates brain neural state into natural conversation.

The NIMCP brain runs 24+ cognitive stages (working memory, curiosity, emotions,
ethics, mirror neurons, etc.) and outputs numeric vectors. This module reads the
brain's actual neural state and translates it into natural language, giving the
brain a "voice" that reflects what it genuinely experiences internally.
