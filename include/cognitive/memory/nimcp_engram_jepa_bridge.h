/**
 * @file nimcp_engram_jepa_bridge.h
 * @brief JEPA bridge for the engram memory system — predictive coding over
 *        memory-trace transitions in embedding space.
 *
 * WHAT: A thin bridge that wraps a JEPA predictor + two reusable latent
 *       buffers and uses them to model transitions between successive
 *       engram embeddings: given a recently observed engram embedding,
 *       predict the embedding of the NEXT recalled engram.
 *
 * WHY:  Engram recall is sequential — one memory trace tends to cue the
 *       next (systems-level replay, pattern completion, hippocampal
 *       chaining). Learning this transition structure in latent space
 *       gives the memory system a lightweight "next-trace predictor"
 *       that can drive cue completion, replay priors, and novelty
 *       signals without reconstructing raw engram state.
 *
 * HOW:  Caller streams engram embeddings in with
 *       engram_jepa_bridge_record(). The bridge keeps the previous
 *       embedding and, whenever a new one arrives, runs one JEPA
 *       train_step on (prev → current). At any time,
 *       engram_jepa_bridge_predict_next() runs a forward pass to return
 *       the predicted next embedding for an arbitrary embed. The bridge
 *       is agnostic about how engram embeddings are produced — it just
 *       operates on raw float vectors of a caller-chosen dimension
 *       (typically 64 or 128).
 *
 * DESIGN:
 *   - Opaque type; internals in the .c file.
 *   - Single shared predictor (not per-engram) — the transition family
 *     we want to learn is shared across traces.
 *   - Light MLP: input_dim = output_dim = hidden_dim = embed_dim,
 *     num_layers = 1, layer norm on, FEP off (this bridge is standalone).
 *   - All heap allocations go through nimcp_calloc / nimcp_free.
 *
 * Modeled after Phase 4m of the octopus cognitive module (see
 * src/cognitive/octopus/nimcp_octopus.c for the integration template).
