 * @brief Broca's Region Initialization Functions
 *
 * WHAT: Initialization functions for Broca's region (language production)
 * WHY:  SRP refactoring - separate Broca initialization logic
 * HOW:  Creates Broca adapter and connects all integration bridges
 *
 * BIOLOGICAL BASIS:
 * - Brodmann areas 44 (pars opercularis) and 45 (pars triangularis)
 * - Syntax processing, phonological planning, speech motor control
 * - Connections to Wernicke's area, motor cortex, prefrontal cortex
 *
 * INTEGRATION BRIDGES:
 * - Substrate Bridge: ATP/fatigue modulation of speech fluency
 * - Thalamic Bridge: VA/VL routing of motor speech commands
 * - Quantum Bridge: Grover-accelerated lexical search

/**
 * @brief Initialize Broca's region subsystem
 *
 * WHAT: Creates Broca adapter and connects all integration bridges
 * WHY:  Enable language production capabilities in the brain
 * HOW:  Creates adapter, then substrate/thalamic/quantum bridges
 *
 * BIOLOGICAL MOTIVATION:
 * - Broca's area is essential for speech production
 * - Damage causes Broca's aphasia (non-fluent speech)
 * - Integrates syntax, phonology, and motor planning
 *
 * INITIALIZATION ORDER:
 * 1. Create Broca adapter (core syntax/phonological/motor)
 * 2. Create substrate bridge (metabolic modulation)
 * 3. Create thalamic bridge (signal routing)
 * 4. Create quantum bridge (accelerated search)
 * 5. Connect to working memory
 * 6. Connect to training system
 * 7. Connect to immune system
 *
 * @param brain Brain instance to initialize

 * @brief Initialize Broca's substrate bridge

 * WHAT: Creates bridge to neural substrate for metabolic modulation

 * HOW:  Links Broca to substrate for biologically-realistic production
 *
 * EFFECTS:
 * - Low ATP → Reduced word retrieval speed
 * - High fatigue → Simplified syntax, articulation errors
 * - Stress → Phonological planning disruption
