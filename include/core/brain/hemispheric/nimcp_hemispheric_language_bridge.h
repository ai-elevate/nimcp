/**
 * @file nimcp_hemispheric_language_bridge.h
 * @brief Lateralized grounded_language wiring across the bilateral
 *        brain (left = dominant for language, right = prosody/emotion).
 * @date 2026-05-05
 *
 * WHAT: Wires the left hemisphere's brain_t->grounded_lang as the
 *       primary linguistic processor and routes language events
 *       across the corpus callosum to the right hemisphere for
 *       emotional/prosodic processing. Models biological aphasia
 *       when callosum is severed or left hemisphere is injured.
 *
 * WHY:  Pre-bridge, the hemispheric brain made no use of GL even
 *       though its docs explicitly assert "Language (Broca's)" lives
 *       in the left hemisphere. Both hemispheres' brain_t could
 *       independently host a GL — wasteful and biologically wrong.
 *       The right hemisphere's documented role (prosody, emotional
 *       tone, narrative gestalt) was unfed.
 *
 * HOW:  Subscribe a callback to the LEFT GL's bus that forwards
 *       COMPREHENDED + PRODUCED events as COGNITIVE-channel callosum
 *       messages, and forwards GROUNDED events with non-zero arousal
 *       as EMOTIONAL-channel messages. The right hemisphere reads
 *       its receive queue on each tick and updates its emotion
 *       state. Lateralization is enforced: the right hemisphere's
 *       GL (if present) is muted by the bridge.
