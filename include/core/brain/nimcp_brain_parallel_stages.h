/**
 * @file nimcp_brain_parallel_stages.h
 * @brief Parallel dispatch for independent cognitive stages in brain_decide()
 *
 * WHAT: Enables concurrent execution of independent pre-forward and post-forward stages
 * WHY:  brain_decide() runs 28 stages serially; many are independent and can be parallelized
 * HOW:  Thread pool dispatch for independent stages, main thread runs sequential stages
 *
 * DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
 *   Pre-forward independent: wellbeing, engram recall, sleep, curiosity, predictive
 *   Post-forward independent: engram consol, systems consol, WM transfer, semantic,
 *                             glial, ToM, Shannon, quantum-Shannon
 *   Post-forward sequential: sleep noise, degradation, executive, emotional, etc.
