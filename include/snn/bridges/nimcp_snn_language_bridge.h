// nimcp_snn_language_bridge.h - SNN ↔ Language Transport Bridge (Option-1)
//=============================================================================
/**
 * @file nimcp_snn_language_bridge.h
 * @brief Transport-only bridge between SNN concept/word populations and
 *        the language system.
 *
 * Option-1 rebuild (Slice A, 2026-05-19): the bridge no longer owns a
 * concept_pop × word_pop STDP weight matrix. Concept patterns are owned
 * by the SNN; the lexicon stores word_id ↔ concept_pop_id indexes
 * (Slice B's concept_registry). This bridge is a pure transport — it
 * routes spikes between concept and word populations and applies K-WTA
 * lateral inhibition (a local-dynamics primitive, not learning).
 *
 * All STDP / weight / binding-learning APIs from the pre-rebuild bridge
 * are now NO-OP stubs that return success. They remain in the header for
 * ABI compatibility with callers (notably grounded_language.c, Slice B's
 * territory) until those call sites are migrated. New code should use the
 * `snn_language_bridge_route_*` family instead.
 *
 * Integrates with:
 * - Grounded Language System (production/comprehension fallback)
 * - Imagination SNN (creative spike patterns → word selection)
 * - Curiosity SNN (novelty-driven lexical exploration)
 * - Neuromodulator system (DA broadcast; bridge passes it through to SNN —
 *   bridge has no weights to modulate of its own)

/* ABI size sentinels.
 *
 * Why: the previous EOS-stopping commit (revert 65337cdbc) crashed with
 * "stack smashing detected" in tests that had been compiled against the
 * pre-EOS struct layout while the library was rebuilt with the larger
 * layout. The library wrote a larger config/stats blob into a stack-
 * allocated caller buffer sized for the older layout (via
 *   *out = bridge->config; *stats = bridge->stats;
 * in snn_language_bridge_get_config / get_stats).
 *
 * These _Static_assert sentinels turn that runtime stack-smash into a
 * clear compile error: any TU compiled with a stale layout will fail
 * the static-assert at -E preprocessing and refuse to produce a .o.
 * Bump the literal here whenever a field is appended to either struct.
 *
 * The numbers below are computed on x86_64 Linux gcc with -fno-pic and
 * default struct packing (verified via build/sizecheck). Bumping a
 * field adds the field's size (rounded up to alignment) — the matching
 * change to the literal MUST land in the same commit so reviewers can
 * see the ABI delta. */
