"""Streaming corpus backends. Each module defines a StreamingSource subclass
and self-registers via register_source() at import time.

To add a new backend, drop a module in this directory that:
  1. Imports streaming_ingest.StreamingSource and register_source.
  2. Defines a subclass with kind, list_for_stage, fetch_chunks, is_complete.
  3. Calls register_source(MyBackend()) at module scope.
  4. Adds itself to the import list below so it's loaded automatically.

Backends are intentionally NOT auto-discovered via os.listdir to keep the
import order deterministic and the load surface explicit. Adding a backend
is a one-line edit here.
